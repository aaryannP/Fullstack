C remains a powerful and widely used programming language, even in today's diverse landscape. Its performance, control over hardware, and portability make it suitable for various applications. Here are three real-world domains where C is extensively used:

1.) Embedded Systems: C's ability to interact directly with hardware makes it the go-to language for embedded systems. These are specialized computer systems designed for specific tasks within larger systems, often with limited resources (memory, processing power).  Examples are:

	Automotive: C is used in engine control units (ECUs), anti-lock braking systems (ABS), and other critical systems in vehicles. 			The need for real-time performance and direct hardware manipulation makes C ideal here.
	Consumer Electronics: Devices like digital cameras, smartwatches, and even microwave ovens often have embedded systems programmed 		in C.
	Industrial Control Systems: Robotics, PLCs (Programmable Logic Controllers), and other automation equipment rely on C for its 			control capabilities and efficiency.
	Networking Equipment: Routers, switches, and other network infrastructure components often use C for their firmware because of 			its performance and ability to handle network protocols efficiently.

2.) Operating Systems:  C's influence on operating systems is profound.

	Kernel Development: The core of many operating systems, including Linux (and thus Android), macOS, and Windows (at least parts of 		it), is written in C. C's low-level access and efficiency are crucial for managing system resources.
	Device Drivers: These are the software components that allow the OS to communicate with hardware. C is commonly used for writing 		device drivers due to its ability to interact with hardware directly.
	System Utilities: Many system-level tools and utilities in operating systems are written in C.

3.) Game Development (Historically and Some Current Use): While C++ is more prevalent in modern game development, C still plays a role and had a much larger role in the past:

	Game Engines (Older): Early game engines and many classic games were written primarily in C. While C++ is now more common for 			complex engines, C's influence is still seen in some areas.
	Performance-Critical Code: Even in modern games, some highly performance-sensitive sections (e.g., physics engines, rendering) 			might use C for optimization. C can give a developer finer control over memory and processing than higher-level 			languages.
	Game Consoles (Older): C was very common in the past for console game development due to the limited resources and the need for 		direct hardware access.
	Embedded Systems within Games: Consoles and arcade games themselves have embedded systems (for controllers, etc.) where C might 		be used.
