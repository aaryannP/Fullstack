        <h1>The Art of Responsive Web Design</h1>
        <h2>How to Make Your Websites Look Great on Any Device</h2>
        <p>
            Responsive web design is essential in today's multi-device world. By using flexible layouts, media queries, and scalable fonts, you can ensure your website looks beautiful and functions well on screens of all sizes.

        <p>
            Choosing the right fonts and adjusting line-height and spacing can greatly improve readability. For headings, a serif font like Merriweather adds elegance, while a sans-serif font such as Open Sans keeps body text clean and easy to read.
